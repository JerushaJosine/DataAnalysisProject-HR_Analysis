  b. Ensure that the data is in normalized format and includes all necessary fields such as employee ID, Name, date/month/year.

      2. Total Work From Home(WFH)% of the employees.
      3. Total Sick Leave(SL)% of the employees.

    d. Add a slice at top-right to select ech month or complete data.
