This README file outlines the steps for performing Human Resource analysis using Excel, SQL and Power BI. The aim of this analysis is to help HR manager to understand the employee attendance patterns, identify trends, and make informatic decisions.

Tools required:

1. Microsoft Excel: to organize and analyze the employee attendance data.
2. Microsoft SQL: to query the employee attendence data stored in a SQL Server database.
3. Power BI Desktop: to create data visualizations and reports based on the Excel and SQL query results.

Steps for Analysis:

1.Data Preparation:
  1. Gather the employee attendance data from various sources such as a time and attendance system, and store it in an Excel sheet.
  2. Ensure that the data is in normalized format and includes all necessary fields such as employee ID, Name, date/month/year.
  3. Save it to the Excel sheet.

2. SQL Query:
 Write SQL queries to retrieve the required data for analysis.
      Examples of queries include:
      1. Total Presence % of attendance for all the employees.
      2. Total Work From Home(WFH)% of the employees.
      3. Total Sick Leave(SL)% of the employees.
    
3. Power BI Visualization:
    1. Open Power BI Desktop and import data from Excel and transform the data.
    2. Create a data visualizations table for Employee's name, Presence %, WFH %, SL % .
    3. Create a matrix filter to see all the Employee's names and Attendance Key for everyday for April, May and June of 2022.
    4. Add a slice at top-right to select each month or complete data.
    5. Add a liner graph and table to Presence% by date and use the filters to Date (on or before June 2022) and Value   (is not WO) and at last add the trend                  line to understand the attendance trend. 
    6. Copy and Paste the graph and change Presence% to WFH% and SL% for the following two graphs.
    7. Add a slicer to check which day of the week and Presence% of the employee's.
    8. Copy paste the same table and change that to check the day of the week and WFH% of the employee's. (Well we all        know the answer it might be Friday or             Monday the most).
    9. paste the same slicer and check the week of the day and SL% to know the which day most of the employees are            absent for the office.
    
4. Report Generation:

    1. Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service.
    2. Share the report with HR manager and other stockholders.
     
Conclusion:
         This Attendance analysis using Excel, SQL, and Power BI is a powerful tool for HR manager to gain insights into their workforce's attendance patterns. By following the above steps, we can create an informative and interactive reports that help in making data-driven decision to imporve employee attendance and productivity.
